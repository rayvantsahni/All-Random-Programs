# Balanced Brackets
Given a string containing only square brackets, `[]`, you must check whether the brackets are balanced or not. The brackets are said to be balanced if, for every opening bracket, there is a closing bracket.

You will write your code in the `check_balance()` function, which returns `True` if the brackets are balanced and `False` if they are not.

For an empty string, the function will return `True`.
