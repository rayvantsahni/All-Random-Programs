# Three or Five
This is a very widely known problem called `FizzBuzz`, with just a minor change.

In this we write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 
* For each multiple of 3, print `Three` instead of the number. 
* For each multiple of 5, print `Five` instead of the number. 
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `Both` instead of the number.
